#PyRSM 
**PyRSM_Lite** is a simplified version of the PyRSM python package for exoplanets detection which applies the **Regime Switching Model** (RSM) framework on ADI (and ADI+SDI) sequences (see Dahlqvist et al. A&A, 2020, 633, A95).
The RSM map algorithm relies on one or several **PSF subtraction techniques** to process one or multiple **ADI sequences** (or ADI+SDI) before computing a final probability map. Considering the large
set of parameters needed for the computation of the RSM detection map (parameters for the selected PSF-subtraction techniques as well as the RSM algorithm itself), a parameter selection framework
called **auto-RSM** (Dahlqvist et al., A&A, 2021, 656, A54) is proposed to automatically select the optimal parametrization. The proposed multi-step parameter optimization framework can be divided into 
three main steps, (i) the selection of the optimal set of parameters for the considered PSF-subtraction techniques, (ii) the optimization of the RSM approach parametrization, and (iii) the 
selection of the optimal set of PSF-subtraction techniques and ADI sequences to be considered when generating the final detection map. 

The *add_cube* and *add_model* methods allows to consider several ADI or ADI+SDI sequences and models to generate
the cube of residuals used to compute the RSM map. The cube should be provided by the same instrument
or rescaled to a unique pixel size. A specific PSF should be provided for each cube. In the case of ADI+SDI, 
a single psf should be provided per cube (typically the PSF averaged over the set of frequencies, as the package 
does not acomodate yet 3-dimensionnal PSF). Five different models and two forward model variants are available. 
Each model can be parametrized separately. The method *like_esti* allows the estimation of a cube of 
likelihoods containing for each pixel and each frame the likelihood of being in the planetary or the speckle 
regime. These likelihood cubes are then used by the *probmap_esti* method to provide the final probability 
map based on the RSM framework. 

The second set of methods regroups the four main methods used by the auto-RSM/auto-S/N framework.
The *opti_model* method allows the optimization of the PSF subtraction techniques parameters based on the 
minimisation of the average annulus-wise contrast. The *opti_RSM* method takes care of the optimization of the parameters 
of the RSM framework (all related to the computation of the likelihood associated to every pixels and frames). The
third method *opti_combination*, relies on a greedy selection algorithm to define the optimal set of 
ADI sequences and PSF-subtraction techniques to consider when generating the final detection map using the RSM
approach. Finally, the *opti_map* method allows to compute the final RSM detection map. The optimization of
the parameters can be done using the reversed parallactic angles, blurring potential planetary signals while
keeping the main characteristics of the speckle noise. An S/N map based code is also proposed and encompasses
the *opti_model*, the *opti_combination* and the *opti_map* methods. For the last two methods, the SNR 
parameter should be set to True.

The last set of methods regroups the methods allowing the computation of contrast curves and the 
characterization of a detected astrophysical signals. The *contrast_curve* method allows the computation
 of a contrast curve at a pre-defined completeness level (see Dahlqvist et al. 2021 for more details), 
 while the *contrast_matrix* method provided contrast curves for a range of completeness levels defined
 by the number of fake companion injected (completeness level from 1/n_fc to 1-1/n_fc with n_fc the number
 of fake companions). This last method provides a good representation of the contrast/completeness 
 distribution but requires a longer computation time. The *target_charact* method allows the 
 estimation of the photometry and astrometry of a detected signal (see Dahlqvist et al. 2022 for more details)

    and astrometry.The erros associated with the photometry and astrometry can be estimated
    via the inversion of the hessian matrix ('hessian') or via the BFGS minimisation approach 
    ('BFGS') which allows to further improve the precision of the estimates but requires 
    more computation time. Default is None, implying no computation of confidence intervals.
* first_guess: boolean, optional
    Define if an initialisation of the algorrithm is done via a standard negfc (using the VIP
    function firstguess) before applying the PSO or Bayesian optimisation. This initialisation
    is useful when the target is very bright. It relies on PCA approach, SNR ratio maps and
    negative fake companion injection to estimate the photometry and astrometry. Default is
    False.
